**What does it do?** _Spring project to output name of some objects in BD._
**For what I did it?** _It was created for me just to remember and understand some things._
**Can you use it?** _If you want to use it just download it and create properties file in resources directory._
**What does it have?** _Spring MVC, Hibernate_

**Some words about structure:**
I don't know how it must be, but something like that, I think:
_All controllers must be in there own files in one directory.
In DAO must be some easy function to work with DB and in Service must be business logic.
There must be interface of all DAOs and Services._
